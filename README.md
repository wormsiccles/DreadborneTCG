# 💀 Dreadborne 💀
Dreadborne is a trading card game (TCG) initially created by indie creator [Valentine In Wonderland](www.instagram.com/valentine.in.wonderland/). It had a distinct horror theme, and takes inspiration from TCGs such as Yu-Gi-Oh and Chaos Galaxy.
## My Contributions
I worked on the initial project as one of 3 artists. After the creator put the project on haitus, I was given control with the direction of the game. I am also the only current artist for the game.
## Plans
### Game Development
The first batch of cards will include 3 sets:
- The Manor: Easy to use, low risk cards. Ideal for beginners still learning the main mechanics.
- The Woods: Cards with good support. Ideal for players who like to improve their cards' attack/defense.
- The Asylum: High risk, high reward cards. A lot of cards include the risk of chance and sacrificing cards/health/etc to gain additional boosts.

These sets will include 50 cards for each boxed set. Though, each set will have upto 100 cards. Dreadborne currently only has 4 rarities: Common, **Rare**, *Mythical*, and Seasonal. A typical Dreadborne set will have 49 Commons and 1 Rare, though there is a slim chance of a Mythical or Seasonal card appearing in the Rare's place.

Additional sets may include the following:
- The Observatory
  - Space
  - Constallations
  - The Strange & Abnormal
- The Circus
  - The Carnival
  - The Amusement Park
- The Library
  - Storybook/Fairytales
- The School
- The Hospital
  - An add on for the Asylum.
- The Graveyard
  - An add on for the Manor.
- The Mall
  - The Pet Shop
  - The Food Court

*Note that for all these names, these are still a work in progress (WIP). The names of the sets and cards will change.*

### Accesibility
There are no current plans for a physical, **public** version, but there will be plans for the following:
- Physical cards for the purpose of prototyping, marketing, and experimenting with the idea of making physical, public copies.
- A dedicated Discord server for playtesting and card ideas.
- A dedicated Discord bot to search every card and their information.
- A dedicated Discord bot to play the game.
- An alternate way for users to play the game.
  - Most likely [screentop.gg](https://screentop.gg/) or some other virtual tabletop that supports TCGs.
