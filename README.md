# 💀 Dreadborne 💀
Dreadborne is a trading card game (TCG) initially created by indie creator [Valentine In Wonderland](www.instagram.com/valentine.in.wonderland/). It had a distinct horror theme, and takes inspiration from Yu-Gi-Oh and Chaos Galaxy.
## My Contributions
I worked on the initial project as one of 3 artists. After the creator put the project on haitus, I was given control with the direction of the game. I am also the only current artist for the game.
## Plans
There are no current plans for a physical version of the game, but there will be plans for the following:
- A dedicated discord bot to play the game.
- An alternate way for users to play the game.
  - Most likely untap.in
