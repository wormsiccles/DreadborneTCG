# 💀 Dreadborne 💀
Dreadborne is a trading card game (TCG) initially created by indie creator [Valentine In Wonderland](www.instagram.com/valentine.in.wonderland/). It had a distinct horror theme, and takes inspiration from Yu-Gi-Oh and Chaos Galaxy.
## My Contributions
I worked on the initial project as one of 3 artists. After the creator put the project on haitus, I was given control with the direction of the game. I am also the only current artist for the game.
## Plans
### Game Development
The first batch of cards will include 3 sets:
- The Manor: Easy to use, low risk cards. Ideal for beginners still learning the main mechanics.
- The Woods: Cards with good support. Ideal for players who like to improve their cards' attack/defense.
- The Asylum: High risk, high reward cards. A lot of cards include the risk of chance and sacrificing cards/health/etc to gain additional boosts.

Additional sets may include the following:
- The Observatory
- The Circus
- The Library

*Note that for all these names, these are still a work in progress (WIP). The names of the sets and cards will change.*
### Accesibility
There are no current plans for a physical version of the game, but there will be plans for the following:
- A dedicated Discord server for playtesting and card ideas.
- A dedicated Discord bot to play the game using [timswyzen's TCG bot](timswyzen/discordTCG).
- An alternate way for users to play the game.
  - Most likely [untap.in](www.untap.in).
